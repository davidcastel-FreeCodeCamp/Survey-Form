# FreeCodeCamp - Survey-Form Project

This is my project for FreeCodeCamp :fax:

<p>
  The lesson was called <em>"Responsive Web Design Projects - Build a Survey Form"</em>.
  
  The purpose of the project was to create a project that will allow me to use the form tags and attributes. My survery asks questions for a programming job with very minimal details. 
  <br>
  There is very few styling involved.
